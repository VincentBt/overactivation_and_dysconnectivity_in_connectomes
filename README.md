# overactivation_and_dysconnectivity_in_connectomes

Python implementation (with interactive code) of the article [Circular Inference predicts non-uniform overactivation and dysconnectivity in brain-wide connectomes. Bouttier, Duttagupta, Den√®ve, and Jardri. Schizophrenia Research, 2021]

The file compute_effects_CI_vs_BP.py allows to produce simulations (example: 'python compute_effects_CI_vs_BP.py modular_SW'). 

Interactive (.ipynb) files beliefs_CI_vs_BP and activation_CI_vs_BP, which produce most figures of the article, can be viewed from here, or alternatively can be run from scratch on your computer.
